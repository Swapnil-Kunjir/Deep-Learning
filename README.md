# Deep-Learning

In this repository I tried to apply neural networks to different datasets

1.ANN applied to diabetes dataset.<br>
2.ANN to MNIST digit recognition dataset.<br>
3.CNN to MNIST digit recognition dataset<br>

I have also tried to give details in my comments in notebook and also tried to provide suggestions that might give you better results (Note: more accuracy does not necessarily means better results. Here meant more robust.)
